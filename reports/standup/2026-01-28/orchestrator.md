# Daily Standup - Orchestrator
**Date:** 2026-01-28

## Accomplished Since Last Standup
- Completed initial project scaffolding with backend directory structure
- Added agent role definitions and sprint tasks in COMPANY.md
- Created database models for users, API keys, and usage tracking
- Added CTO assessment to PRD with risk analysis and recommendations

## Planning to Work On
- Set up Alembic migrations for the database models
- Implement auth feature module (registration/login endpoints)
- Begin API key generation and management endpoints
- Configure Redis connection for rate limiting foundation

## Blockers / Concerns
- Executive roles (CEO, CTO, Tech Lead, QA) still marked TBD - need assignment to parallelize work
- Billing integration scope unclear for MVP (free tier only vs Stripe integration)
- Need decision on image retention policy (affects schema design)
